minor_changes:
- "proxmox_kvm - added additional information to be returned when the option ``state: current`` is used. The current runtime information of the virtual machine is returned in the dictionary ``current`` and the configuration information is returned in the dictionary ``config`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/issues/657)."
